# Calculator
Description: This is a simple calculator project that I built using Java, which was my first programming language. The program can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It prompts the user to enter two numbers and the operation they want to perform, calculates the result, and displays it on the screen. Developing this project was a great way for me to practice my Java skills, especially with regards to input/output, variables, and basic arithmetic operations. I encountered some challenges during the development process, but I was able to overcome them with the help of online resources and tutorials. Overall, this project was a great learning experience for me as a beginner programmer.
This project has given me the confidence to tackle more complex projects in the future, and I'm excited to continue my journey as a programmer.
